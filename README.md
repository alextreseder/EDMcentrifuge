## Concept
The current scope of the project: 
* An consumables free integrated water management system for EDM
* Use as many off the shelf components as possible
* Use laser cut parts where needed
* All stainless parts contacting water (or plastic) (excluding the bowl)
* Use a half barrel beer keg as the sump and centrifuge enclosure
* Use electrodeionzation for long service life
* Use a peltier chiller for temperture stabilization
* Support fast fill and high pressure flush
* Use only water pump

## Disclaimers

**Centrifuges are Dangerous**

The centrifuge bowl is highly robust and its inside a keg which is also highly robust. Nonetheless, it is your responsibiltiy to take the necessary precautions when working with a high inertia flywheel. The kinetic energy of this centrifuge is about 2.8 kJ which is on par with a rifle cartridge. 

**Metric / Imperial**

The design is done in metric however all the fabricated components plus the beer keg itself are imperial out of necessity. 

## Currently In Progress
* Shop around to find an affordable configuration for the valves and plumbing
* Complete benchmark testing for water quality vs flow rate relationship

## Future Goals
Future Development:
* Custom integrated system control PCB (CAN enabled)
* Fully consumables free via electrodeionization module

## Non-Goals
* Not optomized for mass manufacture
* KegStand is designed assuming the user has access to machine shop and fabrication tools

## Alternative Applications
* This is suitable for making bio fuel

## Calculations
Desmos calculators have been made for various applications - they are not necessarily complete
